For this Challenge, you'll use what you've learned in this module to develop the initial scaffolding of your portfolio site from scratch using React.
Modern Development with React: React Portfolio

Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, it's time to develop the initial scaffolding for your first portfolio site, as well as create or update other materials so that you can showcase your skills to potential employers. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.
Instructions

    You must fullfil the requirements listed in the following sections:

Design

Remember, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look "polished" and "professional." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

    Use mobile-first design.

    Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

    Make sure the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

Base Requirements

Your portfolio must meet the following requirements:

    The following technologies must be used:

        React
