  ## Description:

  ### Motivation
  This was an update to an existing portfolio, converting it to React (from Bootstrap), and incporporating recent projects. The goal was to learn more about React, and how to ues it to help create more modular web applications.



  ### Learnings
  I learned the basics of React, and how - once learned - it can simplify a web application by breaking it down into component parts, making changes easier to manage. 

I struggled with deploying the site through Github pages initially and was unable to make the homepage display (only a blank page displayed, along with the header and footer. I was advised that Netlify would resolve this. It didn't. After spending time researching I discover the issue was in my Routes, where I had used the incorrect pathname for the homepage (had set it to '/homepage' rather than' /'. Lesson learned!
